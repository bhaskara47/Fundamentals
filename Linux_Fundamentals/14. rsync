# rsync is used to files/folders from one destination to another in same machine or from one to another machine
# v = verbose --> To visualize the output what exactly going on when you execute the command
# a = archive mode --> To make sure source & destination are exact match including permissions for folders/files/subfolder
# z = compress
# P = To see the Progress

# Syncing Original and Backup folder by copying and deleting

# Copying sync
rsync -av --dry-run original/ backup/ --> Copy Sync Checking
rsync -av original/ backup/           --> Copy all files/folder inside original to backup

# Deleting sync
rsync -av --delete --dry-run original/ backup/  --> Delete Sync Checking
rsync -av --delete original/ backup/            --> If any files were present in backup folder prior this execution of syntax
                         --> Those files will be deleting in backup, since it was just syncing both original & backup folders
