lsblk  --> Show Partitions among disks
df -h  --> Show Partitions among disks
mount  --> will allow to Mount file systems to the linux system

"mount | column -t" --> See mount in a Structured way
mount | grep sdb    --> To see mountpoint for sdb
sudo fdisk -l       --> Show Units, Sector size, I/O size in bytes

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT  --> Show only three columns in lsblk output

lsblk | grep -i "sd"                          --> To see Disks that starts with sd

# Mounting Disk

# fstab is the file where you write configurations for mounting disks
sudo cat /etc/fstab

# Creating a folder that needs to be mounted ( /mnt will be there in linux default, you just create mydisk folder)
sudo mkdir /mnt/mydisk

# To see UUID for /dev/sdb1 ( /dev/sdb1 is where mydisk will be mounted to )
sudo blkid

# Get that UUID and Perform the following steps
sudo vi /etc/fstab
UUID=" " /mnt/mydisk ext4 defaults,ro 0 2

# UUID of Partition
# /mnt/mydisk --> Path that needs to be mounted on,
# ext4 --> File System type
# defaults --> All of the rest will be default
# ro --> Read Only. You do not want everybody to modify content of disk.
# 2 is the Priority in which order the check should be made in case of damage

# This syntax will mount mydisk to sdb1
sudo mount /mnt/mydisk

#This will not only mount mydisk to sdb1, but if any other cases like this in one syntax
sudo mount -a

=============================================================================================================================

# Output of following syntax will be /dev/sdb1 on /mnt/mydisk type ext4 (rw,relatime)
cat /etc/fstab | grep mydisk

# If you do not want your disk to be automatically mounted when doing sudo mount -a, only sudo mount /mnt/mydisk works here
UUID=" " /mnt/mydisk ext4 defaults,ro,noauto 0 2

# Unmounting sdb1
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
