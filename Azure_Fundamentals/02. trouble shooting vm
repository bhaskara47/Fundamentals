Steps to follow:

1)	Does VM is in Running State?
	Check whether you can Connect to the Virtual Machine with “SSH” (Mostly you can’t)

===================================================================================================================================================================
2)	Check Whether NIC is Misconfigured?
	Go Ahead to Portal  VM  Networking  NIC  Settings  IP Configurations
	If you see “Private IP Address” and “Public IP Address” is assigned to the NIC Card then it’s good, NIC is not Misconfigured.
	Assuming even after this you can’t ssh into Virtual Machine. “Go to Option 3”

===================================================================================================================================================================
3)	Check whether traffic is blocked by NSG?
	Go to Settings  Network Security Group, you could see the NSG is attached to this Virtual Machine.
	Then look at Networking  Inbound Port Rules, To “SSH” to this VM there should be “Port 22” opened in these Rules.
	Is there is no such rule created, Create one with
i)	Add Inbound Port Rule  Source (Any)  Source Port Range (*)  Destination (Any)  Custom (SSH)  Action (Allow)  Priority (100)  Name (ssh-allow).
	Assuming even after this you can’t ssh into Virtual Machine. “Go to Option 4”

===================================================================================================================================================================
4)	Check the Response on Run Command?
	Operations  Run Command  Run Shell script
	If any application is Running you can check the status of the Application here.
	Give “ps”  To list all the running Applications on the Virtual Machine.
	Assuming even after this you can’t ssh into Virtual Machine. “Go to Option 5”

===================================================================================================================================================================
5)	Serial Console?
	Serial Console is Direct Access to the Box where your “VM” is running.
	Perform the following commands in the serial console

vi /etc/fstab (False System Table is a File describing how and where things were mounted)

UUID=1 /foo ext4 0 0 ( If you see something like this delete it)

reboot -f (Rebooting the Machine)

Select Ubuntu in the Next Step

	Assuming even after this you can’t ssh into Virtual Machine. “Go to Option 6”

===================================================================================================================================================================
6)	Redeploy?
